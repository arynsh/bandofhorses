  <h2>Get to know the band</h2>
  <p>Band of Horses is an American rock band formed in 2004 in Seattle by Ben Bridwell. Ben Bridwell (vocals, guitar) formed Band of Horses, who were originally briefly known as Horses, in 2004 after the break-up of his previous band, Carissa's Wierd, along with bassist Chris Early and drummer Tim Meinig. They were soon joined by former Carissa's Wierd bandleader Mat Brooke (guitar, vocals).[6] The band initially received attention from Sub Pop after opening for Iron & Wine during Seattle area shows. In 2005, the band released the Tour EP, which was sold at shows and on Sub Pop's website. The band has released five studio albums, the most successful of which is 2010's Grammy-nominated Infinite Arms.[3] The band's lineup, which included Mat Brooke for the debut album, has undergone several changes; the most-recent lineup of Bridwell, Ryan Monroe, Tyler Ramsey, Bill Reynolds, and Creighton Barrett, had been together for several years until Ramsey and Reynolds' departure in 2017, recording three albums. Band of Horses' fifth studio album, Why Are You OK, was released in June 2016.</p>

  <h4>Past Shows</h4>
  <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.</p>
